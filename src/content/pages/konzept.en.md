# The Concept

## What is the Erstwähler Forum?

The **Erstwähler Forum 2026** is a large-scale, cross-school event for political education that brings together students from all participating schools in one common venue.

As a **mandatory event** approved by the school administrations, the forum is aimed at all first-time voters in grades 10 and above (grade 13 by invitation) from **Gymnasium Athenaeum Stade**, **IGS Stade**, and the **Vincent-Lübeck-Gymnasium**.

## Our Goals

The goal is to provide young people with a **practical and non-partisan** access to local politics. We offer insights into the processes of municipal and mayoral elections and provide the opportunity to learn about the political positions and programs of the participating parties firsthand.

## Program

### Panel Discussions

A central component of the school day consists of several **moderated panel discussions** on topics that directly affect the everyday lives of young people.

### Dialogue Formats

The forum is complemented by **dialogue formats** in which students can directly engage in conversations with local candidates.

### Party Market

There will be a kind of **"party market"** — an open area with booths from parties, youth organizations, and other organizations.

## When and Where?

- **Date:** June 2, 2026
- **Time:** 8:00 AM – 2:00 PM
- **Location:** Stadeum, Stade

## Unique
